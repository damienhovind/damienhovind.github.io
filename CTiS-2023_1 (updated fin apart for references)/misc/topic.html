<h1>AI EMULATION IN THE MILITARY</h1>


</ul><h3><p>PROJECT AIM<p></h3>

<h4><p><em>Our project aim is to show the uses of AI technology and virtual reality in the
military and how it can be used to help improve
soldiers responsiveness to hostile situations how to deal with them with the best solution to each situation accordingly and greatly reduce the risk of accidents and injuries which are surprisingly common.

</p></h4></em>
</ul><h3><p>Why we feel this topic is important?<p></h3>
<h4><p><em>We feel this topic is important and will become more necessary over time due to the fact that war is and will always be happening using AI and virtual reality
technology will help make better soldiers and prepare people better, like learning how to react to any situation they may be placed
into and reducing the risks you undergo in live field training. In active duty accidents are the highest cause of deaths in the U.S between
2006-2021 making up 32% of total causalityâ€™s (U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Defense
Casualty Analysis System report provided to CRS, April 1, 2022.) Using AI and virtual reality I feel would help to
greatly reduce that number.</p></h4></em>
